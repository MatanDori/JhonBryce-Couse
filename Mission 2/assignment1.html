                Hello! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matan Dori</span>Matan Dori, and I was born on February 15, 2002, in Israel. 
                <br>
                I'm currently <span style="color: gold;">22 years old</span> and excited to share a little about myself and my interests.
                <br>
                I have a passion for exploring new ideas and diving into different worlds through books. 
                <br>
                My favorite genres include fantasy, physics, and history.
                <br>
                Beyond reading, I stay active by playing football, basketball, tennis, and ping-pong. 
                <br>
                When I'm not on the field or engrossed in a book, I enjoy watching TV series.
                <br>

                <br>
                Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I especially love preparing delicious dishes featuring beef, chicken, and Italian cuisine.
                Nothing beats a homemade bolognese!

                In addition to these interests, I spend time programming and working on various web projects.

                Whenever I have the chance, I like to travel – both within my home country and around the world.
